If you have ample amount of time and have full interest in studies then study everything, else 
1. In unit 1, Study either SHM or Properties of Solids (If lucky they won't mix both). But be thorough with either one of them if SHM study all the derivations neatly.

2. In Unit 2, Page 0-22 is very important later in the upcoming pages if u find any new topics then study them, but do not skip Pg 0-22. Study numericals from Pg 44-48 as they are important. Also, if at the end there is no time to complete the syllabus study only the derivation for Intrinsic semi-conductor if they ask Intrinsic/Extrinsic write off Intrinsic derivation only (If Lucky enough you'll get marks) as the final result is same for both.

3. In Unit 3 study the complete notes which is given.

4. In Unit 4 few derivations are missing like Air wedge etc. these are important derivations so refer PYQs and see whatever is missing and study them by referring to notes given by ur respective teacher.

5. In Unit 5, study how much ever is possible for imp topics and questions refer the PYQs.
